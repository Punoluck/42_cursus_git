General guidelines
	
	- use VirtualBox (or UTM)
	- submit signature.txt (paste the signature of my machine's 			virtual disk in it)file at the root of repo
	- no use of snapshots

Mandatory part


	prohibition

	- no graphical interface
	- no X.org or any graphics server

	
	operating system

	- recommend Debian (latest stable version)

	
	startup program

	- SELinux must be running at the start up 
	and its configuration has to be adapted for the project's needs
	- AppArmor for Debian must be running at the startup too

	
	setup

	- need at least 2 encryted partitions using LVM
	- SSH service will be running on the mandatory port 4242
	for security reason must be not be possible to connect using SSH as root
	- operating the system with UFW firewall and leaving only the port 4242 	open in the virtual machine
	- determine the appropriate size for each partition				avoid unnecessary disk usage
	- firewall (UFW) must be active when you lauch your virtual machine
	- hostname = stitrago42
	- password policy
		- expire every 30days
		- minimum days before the modification = 2days
		- user receive warning message 7days before the expiration
		- at least 10 chars long
		- contain an uppercase, lowercase, number
		- no 3 same consecutive identical chars
		- password must not include the name of the user
		- ?? following rule does not aplly to the root password
		- root password: at least 7 char that are not part of the 			former password (DANG)
		- after setting up your configuration files change 				all the passwords of the accounts present on the virtual machine 		also the root account
	- install and configure sudo following strict rules
	- ?? in addition to the root user, a user with your login as username 
	has to be present, this user has to belong to the user42 and sudo groups	- configuration for sudo group
		- Authentication using sudo has to be  limited to 3 attempts			in the event of an incorrect password
		- custom a error message when a wrong password 					occurs when using sudo
		- archived each action using sudo, both input output				save the log file in the var/log/sudo/ folder
		- enable TTY (security reasons)
		- the path that can be used by sudo must be restricted
		ex. /usr/local/sbin : /usr/local/bin : /usr/sbin : /usr/bin :			/sbin : /bin : /snap/bin
	- monitoring.sh (bash) at server startup display some info 			on all termials every 10 minutes (take a look at wall) 				the banner is optional no error must be visible
		- architecture operating system and its kernel version
		- numberof physical processors
		- number of virtual processors
		- current available RAM and storage on server 					and its utilization rate as %
		- date time of the last reboot
		- whether LVM is active or not
		- number of active connections
		- number of users using the server
		- both IPv4 and MAC(Media Access Control) address
		- number of commands executed with sudo program (check at ar)
	
	
	submission

	- signature.txt :
		how to get it :
		- at the root of the git repo paste signature of 				the machine's virtual disk there 
		to get this signature open the default installation folder 			(folder where VMs are saved)) for Linux ~/VirtualBox VMs/	
		then retrieve signature from the ".vdi" file of the VM 				in ??sha1 format (look for a file start with sha end with .vdi)
		*beware*	
		duplicate your VM or use save state to avoid altering VM's 			signature after 1st eva
		*beware*
		do not turn in the VM in the git repo, instead the signature.txt		will be compared with the VM's signature (must be identical)

	- no snapshots
	- create new account to test SSH service
	- QA for ex.
		why this operating system
		diff between aptitude and apt
		what is SELinux or AppArmor
	- create and assign a new user to a group
	- explain how the monitoring.sh script works					you will also have to interrupt it without modifying it (look at cron)
